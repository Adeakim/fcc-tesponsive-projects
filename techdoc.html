                <p>Most of the reactions in living organisms are catalyzed by protein molecules called enzymes.
                    Enzymes can rightly be called the catalytic machinery of living systems. The real break 
                    through of enzymes occured with the introduction of microbial proteases into washing powders.
                    The first commercial bacterial Bacillus protease was marketed in 1959 and major detergent 
                    manufactures started to use it around 1965.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The industrial enzyme producers sell enzymes for a wide variety of applications. 
                    The estimatated value of market is presently about US$2 billion. Detergents (37%),textiles
                    (12%), starch(11%), baking(8%) and animal feed(6%) are main industries, which use about
                     75% of industrially produced enzymes.

                    Presently more than 3000 different enzymes have been isolated and classified. The enzymes
                    are classified into six major categories based on the nature of the chemical reaction they 
                    catalyze:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Oxidoreductase catalyze oxidation or reduction of substrates</li>
                        <li>Transferase catalyze group transfer</li>
                        <li>Hydrolase catalyze bond breakage with the addition of water</li>
                        <li>Lyases remove groups from substrates</li>
                        <li>isomerases catalyze intramolecular rearrangements</li>
                        <li>Ligases catalyze the joining of two molecules at the expense of chemical energy</li>

                      Some enzymes still extracted from animal and planrt tissues. Enzymes such as papain,
                      bromalain and ficin and other speciality enzymes like lipoxygenase are derived from plants
                      and enzymes pepsin and rennin are derivedfrom animal. Most of the enzymes are produced by 
                      microorganisms in submerged cultures in large reactors called fermentors. The enzyme 
                      production process can be divided into following phases:
                      <ol>
                        <li>selection of enzyme</li>
                        <li>selection of productin stain</li>

                         <li>formulationtion of stable enzyme product</li>
                      </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>Criteria used in the selection of an industrial enzyme include specificity, reaction rate, pH and 
                      temperatureoptima and stability,effect of inhibitors an affinity to substrates. Enzymes used in the
                      industrial applications must usually tolerant against various heavy metals and have no 
                      need for cofactors.

                In choosing the prouction strain several aspects have to be considered. Ideally the enzymes is 
                secreted from the cell. Secondly, the production host should have a GRAS-status. Thirdly, the 
                organism should be able to produce hight amount of the desired enzyme in a reasonable life time frame.
                Most of the industrially used microorganismshave been genetically modified to overproduce the desired 
                activity and not to produce undesired sside activities.

                Once the biological production organism has been geneticallyengineered to overproduce the desrired 
                products, a production process has to be developed. The optimization of a fermentation process includes 
                media composition, cultivation type and process conditions.The large volume industrial industrial enzymes
                are produced in 50-500m<sup>3</sup> fermenters.

              Often enzymes do not have the desired properties for an iddustrial application. One option is find a better 
              enzyme from nature.Another option is to be a better industrial catalyst.Two different methods are presently
               available: a random method called directed evaluation and a protein engineerng method called rational design.

              THis field deals with how are the enzymes used and applied in practical processes. The simplest way to use enzyme
              is to add them into a process stream where they catalyze the desired reation and gradually inactivated during the process.
              This happens in many bulk enzyme applications and the price of the enzymes must be low to make their use economical.  
            </p>
            <code>An alternative way to use enzymes is to immobilize them so that they can be reused. The large enzyme molecule cannot pass 
              thruogh the membrane but the small molecular reaction products can. Many different laboratory methods of enzyme immobilization
              based on chemical reaction, entrapment, specific binding or absorbtion have been developed.

              DNA-technology is an important tool in enzyme industry. Most traditional enzymes are produced by organisms, which have been geneticslly

              language. Genetic engineering means reading and modifying this language. ENzymes are crucial tools in this process.
